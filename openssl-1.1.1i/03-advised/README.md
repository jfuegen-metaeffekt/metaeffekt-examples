# Advised

The example shows a Vulnerability Assessment Dashboard for OpenSSL 1.1.1.o.

Please explore the following aspects:

* OpenSSL 1.x is out of official support, while extended support is ongoing. This will impact on the vulnerability prioritization.
* Based on the prioritization 7 vulnerabilities are marked with priority label 'escalate'. 
* Compare with the OpenSSL 3.0.6 dashboard
* Use the CVSS vector underlying links to access the metaeffekt Universal CVSS Calculator.

You can also use
