### Manual Adjustments

No manual adjustments were made.

### Additional Remarks

Some warnings and errors are not returned through .verify() but rather logged by the JsonLDDeserializer. This seems to be wrong and might be due to the alpha state of the new spdx-java-library. Such warnings are not included in the results below at this time.

### Results
The following results were generated as described in the **Validation Process** section
of the **README.md** and filtered to remove duplicate warnings or errors.
